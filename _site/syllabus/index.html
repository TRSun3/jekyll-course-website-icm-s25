<p><span style="color:red">Red text is tentative</span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: All students must read the <a href="#policies">policies</a> on this syllabus and fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/NaDk4aoLx6ncfeAJ6">this form</a> by the end of week 1 (Fri Jan 17, 11:59PM Eastern).</strong></p>
<h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered what is actually happening on your computer when you press play to listen to a song? Or how the audio effects in your favorite music production software were programmed? Or how machine learning can be used to understand or generate music? If so, this course is for you!</p>
<p>Welcome to <em>Intro to Computer Music</em> (15-322/15-622). Here you will learn the <strong>fundamentals of representing, synthesizing, and processing music and audio with a computer</strong>. This course is both technical and creative---think of it as the <strong>music/audio equivalent to a course on computer graphics</strong>. This course may help directly prepare you for potential careers in music and audio programming, or may be indirectly useful throughout a diverse set of career paths in engineering, science, or the arts.</p>
<p>In-class instruction will be <strong>lecture-based</strong> with <strong>required attendance / participation</strong> (see <a href="#attendance">below</a>). A significant amount of the work for this course will involve <strong>completing programming projects in Python</strong>. You will be asked to exercise both your technical and creative sides in the projects, though grading will be based on technical correctness and ambition, not aesthetics (<strong>no music background required</strong>). Additional information on format and learning resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lectures</strong> will teach computer music concepts at a high level using both programming examples and the underlying mathematics</li>
<li><strong>Projects</strong> will involve building a variety of music software tools and using those tools to accomplish creative goals</li>
<li><strong>In-class participation</strong> in interactive exercises and participation questions</li>
<li><strong>Readings</strong> will complement the conceptual material in the lectures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the fundamental principles of digital audio and audio programming</li>
<li>Implement music sound synthesis and processing algorithms at a low level</li>
<li>Synthesize or manipulate music sound in real time</li>
<li>Implement <em>interactive</em> computer music applications</li>
<li>Learn the basics of computer music <em>composition</em></li>
<li>Analyze and extract information from musical sound</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-is-this-for-">Who is this for?</h3>
<p>This course is open to students from a wide range of backgrounds, from computer science to music and performing arts students.</p>
<p>It is first and foremost a rigorous and technical Computer Science course. The projects will be challenging to those with less experience in programming, especially the projects that come later on in the semester. However, this course also emphasizes understanding of musical concepts. If you have a stronger background in music but are less experienced in computer science, you may find the material conceptually more straightforward than your computer science counterparts even if the programming is more challenging.</p>
<p>This course will also emphasize the mathematics underlying computer music algorithms. You will need to learn and apply basic concepts of sampling theory, the frequency domain, digital filtering, and so on. These subjects will not be taught at the depth that we would expect to see in an ECE course on signals and systems, but they are technical nonetheless.</p>
<p>In general, if you have a solid background in (A) programming in Python, and (B) at least two of {music, math, digital signal processing}, you will likely do fine in this course. Please chat with the instructor if you are concerned about whether or not this course is right for you.</p>
<h3 id="15-622-grad-vs-15-322-undergrad-">15-622 (grad) vs. 15-322 (undergrad)</h3>
<p>This course is taught simultaneously at the undergraduate (15-322) and graduate (15-622) level. Graduate students taking the course under 15-622 are expected to execute an <a href="./projects/grad">ambitious semester-long project</a> in addition to all of the other requirements of 15-322. Details of this project will be posted by early February.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The only formal course prerequisite is that you have taken <em>some</em> introductory programming course (e.g. 15-112 or equivalent), or have the permission of the instructor. Below we also list a few additional informal prerequisites for the course:</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>. Some <strong>basic programming abilities</strong> are required. If you can write simple programs in any language (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, C/C++), you should be able to follow the course. Additionally, you will need a <strong>laptop</strong> running macOS, Windows, or Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong>. A solid understanding of calculus and trigonometry is recommended to follow the underlying mathematics behind computer music (if your calc/trig is a bit rusty, that&#39;s okay), especially for the units around the frequency domain. A basic understanding of probability would be helpful for some units related to machine learning or algorithmic composition.</p>
<p><strong>Not required</strong>. This course does <em>not</em> assume that students have any formal musical training. You do not need to know how to read music. You also do not need to know signal processing (you will learn some basic signal processing in this course).</p>
<h2 id="textbooks">Textbooks</h2>
<p>The main textbooks for this course are. A few readings may come from additional sources---see the <a href="./schedule">schedule</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<h3 id="general-breakdown">General breakdown</h3>
<ul>
<li>(50%) Projects 1-5 (10% each, <a href="#late-projects">see below for late day policies</a>)</li>
<li>(15%) Final project (this project cannot be handed in late)</li>
<li>(15%) Final Exam</li>
<li>(10%) Exam 1</li>
<li>(10%) Exam 2</li>
<li>See important note below on attendance and grading</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attendance-grading">Attendance grading</h3>
<p><strong>Attendance is required, and poor attendance may severely impact your grade</strong>. During most class sessions, there will be some activity that must be completed synchronously and will be used to collect attendance information. You can miss up to 4 classes without penalty, and after that, your maximum grade in the course will be reduced by 3% per missed class.</p>
<p>Formally, your grade for the course is $\min(\text{Actual Grade}, \text{Attendance Ceiling})$, where $\text{Attendance Ceiling} = 100\% - 3\% \cdot [\max(N, 4) - 4]$, and $N$ is the number of classes you were absent for.</p>
<p>Example. Say your actual grade is 95%. If you miss $N=4$ classes, your attendance ceiling would be 100%, and your final grade would be a 95%. If you miss $N=5$ classes, your attendance ceiling would be 97%, but your final grade would still be 95% since it is lower than 97%. However if you miss $N=7$ classes, your attendance ceiling would be 91%, and your final grade would be a 91%.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#39;t have to worry about any of this if you simply come to class!</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:red"><strong>Please do not come to class if you are sick</strong>.</span> Instead, send the TAs or instructors a private message on Piazza with the subject <code>[Absence due to illness]</code> and we will provide you with the recording. You will be given credit for that day&#39;s attendance activity if you message us <em>before</em> class briefly explaining that you had a health issue and could not attend. More than several instances of missed classes due to illness will prompt us to notify Student Support Resources to check on your well-being.</p>
<h3 id="late-projects">Late projects</h3>
<p>Your project grades mainly consist of two parts: autograding and TA grading, and there will occasionally be some possible bonus points. The breakdown of autograding and TA grading will vary by project (see each project description for details).</p>
<p>For each project (except Project 0 which is just &quot;practice&quot;), your <strong>adjusted project grade</strong> is your actual project grade multiplied by a late factor that linearly decreases from 1.0 (0 days late) to 0.5 (6 days late), and then drops sharply to 0 afterwards. One &quot;day&quot; is defined as any duration between 1 second and 24 hours after the homework deadline. <strong>To avoid receiving a zero, you must submit projects no later than 6 days (144 hours) after the specified deadline</strong>. More precisely, your project grade is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let $G$ = your actual project grade after automatic and TA grading</li>
<li>Let $L$ = number of days late<ul>
<li>Before deadline, $L = 0$</li>
<li>One second after deadline, $L = 1$</li>
<li>One day and one second after deadline, $L = 2$</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your adjusted project grade will be computed as<ul>
<li>If $L &lt;= 6$, then $G \cdot [(12 - L) / 12]$</li>
<li>Otherwise: $0$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have <strong>3 grace days across all projects throughout the entire semester</strong>. <strong>At most one grace day can be used per project, except for your final projects (no grace days may be used for these)</strong>. These grace days will automatically reduce your late penalty $L$ by up to one. For example, if you submit Project 1 two days late, Project 2 one day late, Project 3 three days late, and Project 4 three days late, your $L$ values for those projects would be $1, 0, 2, 3$ respectively inducing maximum grades of $91.7\%, 100\%, 83.3\%, 75\%$, and you will also have used all of your grace days.</p>
<p>Please contact the teaching staff if the project grading policy is unclear.</p>
<h3 id="15622-grad-students">15622 (Grad) Students</h3>
<p>Your <a href="./projects/grad">term project</a> will be worth an additional 10%, for a total of 110%. Your final grade will then be scaled back to 100% total. Details for the grad project will be posted by early February.</p>
<h3 id="letter-grades">Letter grades</h3>
<p>Generally, if your final score using the above breakdown ends up at 90% or higher, you are going to get an A in the class. If your score ends up at 80% or higher, you are guaranteed at least a B. A score of 70% or higher is guaranteed at least a C. And so on. For graduate students, we may add a + or – to the grade if it is near the top or bottom of any grade range.</p>
<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>
<h3 id="attendance-and-class-recordings">Attendance and class recordings</h3>
<p><strong>You are expected to be present for each lecture</strong>. Attendance is required and will affect your grade (see <a href="#grading">grading</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Lectures will be recorded but will not be posted until a few days before each exam for review purposes</strong>. Hence, come to lecture!</p>
<p><strong>You are not authorized to record lectures yourself unless you have discussed with us about a CMU-approved accommodation that explicitly permits you to do so</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If you are sick or otherwise cannot attend due to health reasons, please do not come to lecture</strong>. Instead, send the TAs or instructors a <strong>private message on Piazza</strong> with the subject <code>[Absence due to illness]</code> and we will provide you with the recording. You will not be penalized for an absence if you message us briefly explaining that you had a health issue and could not attend. More than several instances of missed classes due to illness will prompt us to notify Student Support Resources to check on your well-being.</p>
<h3 id="late-make-up-work">Late / make-up work</h3>
<p>Our course policy on late / make-up projects is summarized below (see <a href="#project-grading">project grading</a> for details):</p>
<ul>
<li>You can turn in projects 1-6 up to 6 days (144 hours) late. Penalty increases linearly up to 50%</li>
<li>You have three total &quot;grace days&quot; throughout the semester to offset late days. Only one can be used per project.</li>
<li>You may not hand in projects after they are over 6 days late</li>
<li>We have set the final project deadline as late as possible to give studnts as much time as possible, therefore <strong>no late or grace days are available for the final project</strong></li>
<li>If you submit to Gradescope between the project deadline and 6 days later, we will grade that version and your project will be counted as late (even if you submitted a version before the deadline)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not offer late or make-up exams except in cases where there is a <a href="#accommodations">CMU-approved accommodation</a>, a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/examination-policies.html#:~:text=A%20student%20who%20has%20more,for%20assistance%20in%20resolving%20conflicts">CMU-recognized exam conflict</a>, or serious extenuating circumstances (contact the instructor).</p>
<h3 id="re-grading">Re-grading</h3>
<p>Re-grades will be considered on a case-by-case basis for the <strong>TA graded portions of projects only</strong>. Please write to icm-csd@cmu.edu if you feel your project was graded unfairly.</p>
<p>Except in fringe cases, <strong>re-grades will not be considered if there was confusion about the requirements in the project description</strong>. If there is any ambiguity in the expectations, you must reach out about this ahead of the submission deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Re-grades will not be considered for autograded portions of projects</strong>. If you are encountering any issues with the autograder, you must reach out about this ahead of the submission deadline.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>
<p>All students are expected to be familiar with, and to comply with, the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html">University Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism</a>.</p>
<p>We regard programming, especially for sound and music, as a creative process. There is never just one way to program a task, and tasks in this course intentionally require some creativity.</p>
<p>Any work submitted as a homework assignment/project must be entirely your own creative work and may not be derived from the work of others, whether a published or unpublished source, the world wide web, another student, other textbooks, materials from another course (including prior semesters of this course), or any other person or program (including AI based code- and text-generation programs, except as noted above). You may not copy, examine, or alter anyone else’s homework assignment or computer program, or use a computer program to transcribe or otherwise modify or copy anyone else’s files. And you are obligated not to share your assignment answers with students in class (including subsequent semesters of this course). Posting assignment solutions on a website for others to view, both publicly or by subscription, is also a violation of academic integrity in this class.</p>
<p>You may adapt or incorporate examples used in lectures, shown in class, or presented by TAs, but only if you understand the examples, and only if the result contains significant creative additions and alterations.</p>
<p>To facilitate cooperative learning, it is permissible to discuss a homework assignment with other students, provided that the following whiteboard policy is respected. A discussion may take place at a whiteboard/blackboard, physical or virtual, or using scrap paper, etc., but no one is allowed to take notes or record the discussion of what is written on the board, and you must allow FIVE hours to lapse after any discussion and erasing before working on the assignment. The fact that you can recreate the solution from memory is taken as proof that you actually understood it.</p>
<p>It is not acceptable to share your solutions or give hints to your friends for projects and exercises after you have already discovered the correct idea. You are not helping your friends by doing so. The right thing to do is to not talk about the problem after you have a solution, and anyone struggling with the homework should visit office hours to talk to an instructor or TA. This shows the respect deserved by your friends as well as the people who have put a lot of effort into creating the problems. <strong>If you find that you are struggling to keep up due to personal issues, contact an instructor; we may be able to help with a short extension to lower the stress and help you recover.</strong></p>
<p>In order to deter cheating on assignments, we also run automatic code comparison programs. These programs are very good at detecting similarity between code, even code that has been purposefully obfuscated. Such programs can compare a submitted assignment against all other submitted assignments, against all known previous solutions of a problem, etc. The signal-to-noise ratio of such comparisons is usually very distinctive, making it very clear what code is a student’s original creative work and what code is merely transcribed from some other source. Often in previous semesters, however, we have discovered cheating due to the simple fact that the TAs are familiar with many different versions of the solution. Cheating is simply not worth the risk and, in the end, it does you no good. Start each assignment early, ask for help before the TAs get overloaded, and you won’t get yourself into time crunches at the last minute.</p>
<p>Receiving credit for an assignment is not an indication that we did not detect cheating. We understand the seriousness of receiving a charge of a violation of academic integrity so we review patterns of submissions very carefully before submitting a charge. Cheating on examinations can result in an immediate charge. A charge usually leads to unfavorable outcomes for the students involved. Consequences for cheating may be as severe as failing this course, and all students charged with cheating are reported to the Office of Community Standards and Integrity for further review by the University for additional sanctions.</p>
<h3 id="generative-ai-tools">Generative AI tools</h3>
<p><span style="color:red">Need to rework this</span></p>
<p>If you so desire, you <em>may</em> use ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other LLM-based tools in your course projects for a <span style="color:blue"><strong>small number of allow-listed use cases</strong></span>. Allowed use cases include (see examples below):</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Interactive reference manual&quot;: Asking questions about code examples</li>
<li>&quot;Bulk text manipulation&quot;: Automatically perform painstaking text manipulation tasks</li>
</ol>
<p>All other use cases are prohibited at this time. In particular, you are <span style="color:red"><strong>explicitly prohibited from using LLM-based tools to generate code to fulfill high-level project requirements</strong></span> (see example below). If you use LLM tools, you are also <span style="color:blue"><strong>required to submit a simple disclosure statement (<code>llm.txt</code>) in your project zip file</strong></span> (see example below). <span style="color:red"><strong>If we determine you have used an LLM tool without disclosure or in a manner that does not conform with the above allowed use cases, you will receive a 0 and could receive an academic integrity violation!</strong></span> If you have any doubts about if your use of LLM tools is appropriate, just don&#39;t use them.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>ChatGPT knows very little about Nyquist and tends to hallucinate incorrect information quite a bit</strong>. Hence, your mileage using it may vary.</p>
<h4 id="-span-style-color-blue-example-disclosure-llm-txt-span-"><span style="color:blue">Example disclosure (<code>llm.txt</code>)</span></h4>
<p>I used ChatGPT to help with this assignment in the following ways:</p>

<li>Allowed use case #1: Used it to help me understand the meaning of the “#t” symbol in Nyquist</li>
<li>Allowed use case #2: Asked it to incorporate a list of harmonic amplitudes [1.0, 0.5, 0.25, etc.] into Nyquist syntax</li>

The instrument should consist of a table created as shown in the lectures using the build-harmonic function and containing at least 8 harmonics, an oscillator (use osc), and an envelope.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-devices">Mobile devices</h3>
<p>We would prefer if students did not use their mobile devices during lectures. Laptops and tablets are okay.</p>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="student-wellness">Student wellness</h3>
<p>Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester both physically and mentally. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.</p>
<p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/">http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>. You may also consider contacting CMU&#39;s <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/health-education-and-resources/peer-health/index.html">Peer Health Advocates</a> program. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:</p>

<h3 id="diversity">Diversity</h3>
<p><strong>We must treat every individual with respect.</strong> We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.</p>
<p>Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion</strong>: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150</li>
<li><strong>Report-It online anonymous reporting platform</strong>: <a href="http://reportit.net">http://reportit.net</a> username: <em>tartans</em> password: <em>plaid</em></li>
</ul>
<p>All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.</p>

This primarily involves work at the intersection of music and AI, though also includes work on other applications such as code, gaming, and language. Chris’s research has been featured in live performances by professional musicians like <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/fruitgenie">The Flaming Lips</a>, and also empowers hundreds of daily users to convert their favorite music into interactive content through his website <a href="https://beatsage.com">Beat Sage</a>. His work has also received coverage from MIT Tech Review, The Verge, Business Insider, and Pitchfork. Before CMU, Chris was a postdoctoral scholar in the CS department at Stanford advised by Percy Liang. Chris holds a PhD from UC San Diego where he was jointly advised by Miller Puckette (music) and Julian McAuley (CS).</p>
